               My first actual job. I believe I was 18 years old. Did it for as long as I could.
               But then realized playing ball and working wasn't the best idea.

           <h2>Express</h2>

               My second job that didn't last long. Worked for 3 months because I enjoyed the extra
               money. Shortly after I was indirectly informed by my assistant coach that
               I could no longer work.

               This was my on campus job. After my collegiate basketball career I took on a work study 
               position. Nice experience with working in an office setting and giving back time to students.
               Also was a great place to help minority students.

           <h2>Best Buy</h2>

               The beginning of the end. My first real job I guess you could say. I started working in the 
               digital imaging department. This department also encompassed, mp3 media, gaming, and car audio.
               I became bored and made a move to a more serious position which was an autotech installer/technician. 
               This position wasn't the average part time role. It demanded a certification through the CEA and lots 
               of real time experience. I eventually succeeded to the Master Lead Technician role which is similar
               to an install bay manager. All the responsibility of a leader and all the work of a normal technician.
               After working in the position for 7 years, I then made a move to field/inhome work. This is my current
               position at Best Buy. I pretty much do any and everything regarding technology within the home or office.
